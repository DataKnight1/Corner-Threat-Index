Routine	Inspection:	A	playbook	for	corner	kicks

Laurie	Shaw,	Harvard	University	and	Sudarshan	Gopaladesikan,	SL	Benfica

1. Introduction

A	corner	kick	is	awarded	in	soccer	when	the	ball	goes	out	of	play	over	the	goal	line	(but	not	into	the
goal)	having	last	been	touched	by	a	member	of	the	defending	team.	The	attacking	team	restarts	play
by	kicking	the	ball	from	the	corner	of	the	field	closest	to	where	the	ball	went	out.	Often,	teams	will
attempt	 to	 create	 a	 goal	 scoring	 opportunity	 by	 crossing	 the	 ball	 directly	 into	 their	 opponent’s
penalty	area,	aiming	for	one	of	several	attacking	players	maneuvering	in	the	penalty	area.

On	average,	teams	win	approximately	five	corner	kicks	per	game.	This	provides	each	team	with	five
opportunities	to	execute	a	corner	strategy	that	they	have	rehearsed	in	training.	Although	the	average
conversion	rate,	the	proportion	of	corners	that	directly	produce	a	goal,	is	very	low	(around	2%	in
most	elite	leagues1),	some	teams	have	achieved	much	higher	conversion	rates,	attributed	to	careful
planning	and	meticulous	execution	of	corner	strategies	[1].	FC	Midtjylland	are	a	well-known	example,
dedicating	up	to	four	training	sessions	per	week	to	practicing	corners	[2].	Midtjylland	won	the	Danish
Superliga	title	in	2014-15	(and	again	in	2017-18)	scoring	an	unusually	high	proportion	of	goals	from
corners	and	other	set-piece	situations.

How	 do	 teams	 like	 Midtjylland	 successfully	 convert	 corner	 kicks	 into	 goals?	 Previous	 work	 has
focused	on	general	metrics	for	defining	offensive	corner	strategy,	such	as	the	ball	delivery	trajectory
(e.g.,	in-swinging,	out-swinging	or	straight),	the	ball	delivery	zone	(towards	the	near	post,	far	post,
or	center	of	the	goal),	the	number	of	attacking	players	involved	and	whether	they	were	‘static'	or
‘dynamic'	[1,3,4,5,6].	In	particular,	[1]	found	that	a	corner	was	more	likely	to	be	scored	on	the	second
ball	(after	a	previous	touch	from	teammate)	than	directly	from	the	corner	kick.	From	a	defensive
perspective,	they	found	that	hybrid	systems	–	mixtures	of	man-to-man	and	zonal	marking	–	concede
the	most	dangerous	shots	compared	to	purely	zonal	or	man-to-man	marking	systems.	[4]	analyzed
the	factors	that	lead	to	a	shot	on	goal,	finding	that	match	time,	the	number	of	intervening	attackers
and	whether	the	attack	was	‘dynamic’	were	the	most	significant	variables.

The	 advent	 of	 player	 tracking	 data	 has	 made	 it	 possible	 to	 perform	 a	 detailed	 analysis	 of	 the
synchronized	 runs	 made	 by	 the	 attacking	 players	 –	 the	 rehearsed	routines	 that	 define	 the	 core	 of
offensive	corner	strategy.		By	identifying	and	classifying	distinct	corner	routines,	we	can	find	those
that	 most	 frequently	 create	 high-quality	 scoring	 opportunities.	 Using	 statistical	 and	 machine
learning	techniques,	we	have	developed	tools	to	classify	the	coordinated	runs	made	by	the
attacking	 players	 during	 corner	 kicks,	 enabling	 us	 to	 identify	 the	 distinct	 corner	 routines
employed	by	teams	in	tracking	data.

1	In	the	2019-20	Portuguese	Primeira	Liga	season,	just	45	goals	were	scored	from	3082	corners:	a
1.5%	conversion	rate.	In	the	German	Bundesliga	the	rate	was	1.9%,	and	just	0.8%	in	Spain's	La	Liga.

1

Tracking	data	can	also	be	used	to	identify	and	classify	the	defensive	strategies	used	by	teams	to	repel
corner	 kicks.	 While	 teams	 are	 generally	 described	 as	 using	 either	 a	 zonal,	 man-to-man	 or	 hybrid
system,	[1]	demonstrated	that	80%	of	the	teams	in	the	English	Premier	League	use	a	hybrid	system.
However,	‘hybrid’	encompasses	a	wide	range	of	defensive	options,	most	notably	in	the	number	of
zonal	defenders	and	where	their	zones	are	located.	To	study	defensive	strategy	in	more	detail,	we
have	 developed	 a	 supervised	 classification	 algorithm	 to	 identify	 the	 roles	 of	 individual
defenders	in	corner	kick	situations.	We	use	our	role	classification	algorithm	to	demonstrate	that
some	hybrid	systems	are	more	effective	than	others	in	repelling	corner	kicks	crossed	into	the	area.

This	 work	 has	 numerous	 practical	 applications.	 Our	 methodology	 enables	 us	 to	 reconstruct	 an
opponent’s	corner	kick	playbook	using	data	from	any	number	of	their	previous	games.	Offensively,
we	 identify	 the	 distinct	 routines	 used	 by	 a	 team,	 identifying	 the	 key	 runs	 made	 by	 the	 attacking
players	and	assessing	the	quality	of	chances	created.	Defensively,	we	can	identify	which	defenders
typically	mark	man-to-man	and	which	mark	zonally,	study	where	the	zonal	defenders	are	positioned,
and	assess	the	strengths	and	weaknesses	of	different	defensive	systems.	Finally,	a	useful	by-product
of	our	methods	is	a	new	system	for	encoding	attacking	player	runs;	we	discuss	how	this	can	be	used
to	help	players	quickly	learn	new	corner	kick	routines.

2. Data

We	make	use	of	tracking	and	event	data	for	234	matches	from	a	single	season	of	an	elite	European
professional	league.	The	tracking	data	for	each	match	consists	of	the	positions	of	all	22	players	and
the	ball,	sampled	at	a	frequency	of	25Hz.	Individual	player	identities	are	tagged	in	the	data,	enabling
tracking	of	each	player	over	time.	The	event	data	consists	of	a	log	of	every	on-ball	action	that	took
place	 during	 a	 match	 (e.g.,	 passes,	 shots,	 tackles	 and	 interceptions),	 the	 identity	 of	 the	 players
involved	and	the	time	and	location	on	the	pitch	at	which	the	event	occurred.

We	use	the	event	data	to	provide	an	initial	estimate	for	the	time	at	which	corner	kicks	occurred.	To
identify	the	exact	frame	at	which	the	corner	was	taken,	we	use	a	combination	of	factors	including	the
acceleration	of	the	ball	and	a	ball-in-play	flag	included	in	the	tracking	data.	After	removing	short
corners	(which	are	not	included	in	this	analysis)	and	a	small	number	of	corners	for	which	there	were
ball	tracking	errors,	we	were	left	with	a	sample	of	1723	corner	kicks.	Finally,	to	aid	comparisons,	we
reflected	the	positions	of	the	players	and	the	ball	so	that	corners	always	appear	to	be	taken	from	the
left	side	of	the	field.

3. Classifying	corner	routines

Figure	 1	 illustrates	 two	 examples	 of	 corner	 routines	 in	 our	 sample.	 The	 offensive	 strategies
demonstrated	in	each	example	are	distinct,	particularly	in	the	starting	positions	of	the	players,	their
trajectories	and	the	delivery	target	of	the	ball.	One	of	the	main	objectives	of	this	work	is	to	develop
tools	 to	 search	 tracking	 data	 to	 identify	 the	 unique	 corner	 routines	 used	 by	 a	 team	 over	 many
matches.	We	achieve	this	by	developing	a	classification	system	to	describe	corner	routines	in	terms
of	the	runs	made	by	the	players	in	the	attacking	team.

2

Figure	1:	A	graphical	representation	of	two	different	corner	routines	in	our	sample.	The	red	(blue)	markers	indicate	the
positions	 of	 the	 attacking	 (defending)	 players	 two	 seconds	 before	 the	 corner	 is	 taken.	 The	 dashed	 lines	 indicate	 each
player's	trajectory	as	the	ball	is	crossed	into	the	area.	The	solid	black	line	indicates	the	path	of	the	ball.

Our	methodology	for	analyzing	offensive	corner	routines	has	two	steps:

1.  Gaussian	mixture	modelling	to	classify	attacking	player	runs	into	tuples	based	on	their	start

and	end	locations;	and

2.  a	topic	model	(using	non-negative	matrix	factorization)	to	identify	runs	that	frequently	co-

occur	in	corner	routines.

We	 now	 describe	 each	 of	 these	 steps	 in	 more	 detail.	 Note	 that	 the	 trajectory	 of	 the	 ball	 does	 not
feature	 in	 our	 system.	 This	 is	 because	 the	 ball	 does	 not	 always	 reach	 the	 intended	 target,	 either
because	it	was	intercepted	by	a	defending	player	or	because	the	cross	was	not	sufficiently	accurate.

3.1. Classifying	player	runs

The	basic	building	blocks	of	a	corner	routine	are	the	individual	runs	made	by	the	attacking	players.
We	define	a	run	entirely	in	terms	of	the	initial	and	target	location	of	each	player;	we	do	not	attempt
to	model	their	full	trajectory.	Initial	positions	are	measured	exactly	two	seconds	before	the	corner	is
taken,	which	corresponds	to	the	moment	at	which	the	average	speed	of	the	attacking	players	starts
to	rise	as	they	begin	their	runs.	The	target	locations	are	defined	as	being	either	the	positions	of	the
players	exactly	one	second	after	the	first	on-ball	event	following	the	corner,	or	two	seconds	after	the
corner	is	taken,	whichever	occurs	first2.	It	is	impossible	to	know	the	true	target	location	of	a	player,
we	simply	assume	that	attacking	players	always	reach	their	intended	target.

We	allocate	players	to	distinct	pairs	of	zones	based	on	their	initial	and	target	locations.	These	zones
are	defined	using	the	distribution	of	the	initial	and	target	positions	of	all	the	attacking	players	over
our	entire	sample	of	corners.	The	process	starts	with	the	distribution	of	the	target	positions.	The
upper	panel	of	Figure	2	shows	the	target	positions	of	nearly	15000	attacking	players	measured	over
the	1723	corners	in	our	sample	(only	players	in	the	attacking	quarter	of	the	field	are	plotted).	The
large	cloud	of	points	in	the	top-left	corner	corresponds	to	the	positions	of	the	corner-takers	shortly
after	each	corner	is	taken.

2	Measuring	positions	one	second	after	the	first	on-ball	event	following	the	corner	kick	helps	to
identify	the	target	position	of	players	aiming	to	reach	the	ball	following	a	touch	from	a	teammate.

Figure	2:	(upper	left	plot)	The	target	positions	of	all	~15000	attacking	players	in	our	sample	of	corners.	(lower	left)	The
results	of	the	15-component	GMM	fit	to	the	target	positions	-	the	seven	‘active	zones'	in	the	penalty	area	are	represented
by	blue	ellipses	and	labelled	a-g.	(upper	right)	The	initial	positions	of	all	15000	attacking	players	-	players	colored	blue	are
tagged	as	‘active’.	(lower	right)	The	results	of	a	6-component	GMM	fit	to	the	initial	positions	of	the	active	players.

Target	 zones	 are	 defined	 by	 fitting	 a	 15-component	 Gaussian	 Mixture	 Model	 (GMM)	 using	 the
expectation-maximization	algorithm	[7,8].	We	find	that	15	components	(that	is,	15	bivariate	normal
distributions)	 are	 sufficient	 and	 that	 adding	 further	 components	 does	 not	 result	 in	 a	 significant
improvement	in	the	log-likelihood	of	the	fit.	The	lower-left	panel	of	Figure	2	shows	each	of	the	15
components	 in	 the	 GMM.	 The	 seven	 components	 of	 the	 model	 located	 in	 the	 penalty	 area	 are
indicated	 by	 blue	 ellipses	 and	 labelled	 a	 to	 g:	 we	 henceforth	 refer	 to	 these	 as	 the	 active	 zones.
Individual	points	belonging	to	an	active	zone	are	colored	accordingly.	Players	with	a	target	position
near	one	of	these	seven	active	zones	are	assumed	to	be	directly	involved	in	the	corner	routine:	these
are	referred	to	as	active	players.	Players	that	do	not	end	their	runs	near	an	active	zone	are	ignored	in
the	remainder	of	this	work.

The	upper-right	panel	of	Figure	2	shows	the	initial	positions	of	attacking	players,	two	seconds	before
the	corner	is	taken.	Active	players	are	colored	blue	and	form	two	groups:	the	players	starting	inside
the	six-yard	box	and	the	players	that	are	initially	clustered	around	the	penalty	spot.	Points	colored
black	are	players	that	were	not	actively	involved	in	the	corner	(including	the	corner-taker,	who	is	no
longer	 involved	 after	 taking	 the	 corner).	 To	 define	 the	 initial	 zones	 of	 active	 players	 we	 fit	 a	 6
component	GMM	model	to	their	initial	positions	(iteratively	removing	outliers).	The	six	components
of	our	fit	are	labelled	1-6	in	the	lower-right	panel	of	Figure	2.

Allocating	players	to	initial	and	target	zones	enables	a	simple	encoding	of	player	runs.	Active	players
are	assigned	to	an	initial	zone	(1-6)	and	a	target	zone	(a-g)	based	on	their	initial	and	target	positions.
For	example,	in	the	left	panel	of	Figure	1,	the	four	attacking	players	that	start	their	runs	next	to	the
penalty	 spot	 are	 initially	 in	 zone	 4,	 running	 to	 target	 zones	 b,	 c	 and	 d.	 Their	 runs	 are	 therefore
encoded	 as	 {4b,4b,4c,4d}.	 In	 total	 there	 are	 42	 possible	 runs	 in	 our	 system,	 corresponding	 to	 all
pairwise	combinations	of	the	6	initial	zones	and	7	active	target	zones.

4

All	the	runs	made	by	the	attacking	players	during	a	corner	kick	can	be	represented	by	a	42-element
vector	in	which	each	element	corresponds	to	a	unique	run,	with	its	value	being	the	number	of	players
that	made	that	run.	Rather	than	assigning	each	player	to	a	single	run	type,	we	make	use	of	the	GMM
weights	 to	 calculate	 the	 probability	 that	 they	 made	 each	 of	 the	 42	 run	 types	 by	 multiplying	 the
probability	that	they	started	in	the	corresponding	initial	zone	and	ended	in	the	corresponding	target
zone.	This	process	is	described	in	more	detail	in	Appendix	1.

3.2. Topic	modelling	of	run	combinations

The	runs	made	by	the	attacking	players	are	coordinated	and	synchronized:	some	players	will	attempt
to	 draw	 away	 defenders,	 while	 others	 will	 attempt	 to	 intercept	 the	 ball.	 The	 second	 step	 of	 our
method	is	to	identify	the	types	of	runs	that	are	frequently	combined	in	the	same	routine.	To	achieve
this,	 we	 draw	 inspiration	 from	 topic	 modelling,	 making	 the	 analogy	 between	 runs	 and	 words,
combinations	of	runs	and	topics,	and	corner	kicks	and	documents.

We	use	non-negative	matrix	factorization	(NMF)	to	find	a	representation	of	the	corners	in	our	data
in	terms	of	a	basis	set	of	run	combinations	[9,10,11].		NMF	approximates	an	initial	matrix,	called	the
term	matrix	as	the	product	of	two	lower-rank,	non-negative	matrices	W	and	H.	Our	term	matrix	has
the	following	dimensions:	42	rows	by	1723	columns.	The	rows	represent	all	42	combinations	of	the
6	initial	and	7	target	zones,	and	each	column	represents	a	corner	in	our	data	set.	W	represents	the
run	combinations	that	frequently	co-occur	in	the	data;	H	tells	you	how	to	construct	each	corner	in
the	data	from	those	run	combinations.	Further	technical	details	are	provided	in	Appendix	2.

We	 find	 that	 the	 corners	 in	 our	 data	 can	 be	 accurately	 reconstructed	 from	 a	 set	 of	 30	 run
combinations	 (henceforth	 referred	 to	 as	 features);	 these	 features	 are	 shown	 in	 Figure	 3.	 In	 some
cases,	a	feature	consists	of	just	a	single	run	–	this	is	because	the	same	run	may	occur	in	many	different
types	of	corner	routines.

Figure	3:	The	thirty	features,	or	frequently	co-occurring	runs,	identified	by	our	topic	model.

5

Every	 corner	 in	 our	 sample	 can	 be	 described	 in	 terms	 of	 these	 features.	 For	 example,	 the	 corner
depicted	in	the	left	panel	of	Figure	1	strongly	exhibits	features	9	and	19,	which	describe	the	runs	from
the	penalty	spot	towards	the	near	post,	goal	center	and	far	post.	The	corner	depicted	in	the	right
panel	of	Figure	1	strongly	exhibits	feature	12,	which	describes	the	run	from	the	near	post	towards
the	far	post.	Both	corners	also	exhibit	feature	25	–	an	attacking	player	standing	close	to	where	the
goalkeeper	would	be	located.

Encoding	corners	in	the	feature	space	enables	us	to	rapidly	search	very	large	samples	of	corners	to
find	those	that	exhibit	a	certain	feature	of	interest,	or	a	combination	of	features.	Figure	4	shows	other
corners	 in	 our	 sample	 that	 strongly	 exhibit	 feature	 12:	 there	 are	 clear	 similarities	 between	 the
routines	 depicted,	 particularly	 the	 curving	 run	 made	 by	 a	 player	 from	 one	 goal	 post	 towards	 the
other.	One	team	in	particular	in	our	dataset	made	frequent	use	of	the	routines	shown	in	Figure	4.

Figure	4:	Ten	corners	in	our	sample	that	strongly	exhibit	feature	12	–	runs	from	the	near	post	round	to	the	far	post.	Only
attacking	team	players	are	shown.	Dots	indicate	the	initial	positions	of	each	player	and	dashed	lines	show	their	trajectories.

Distinct	 corner	 routines	 in	 our	 dataset	 can	 be	 identified	 by	 grouping	 corners	 that	 exhibit	 similar
feature	expressions	(the	columns	of	the	H	matrix)	using	agglomerative	hierarchical	clustering.	We
present	the	distinct	corner	routines	found	for	individual	teams	in	our	data	in	Section	5.1.

4. Identifying	defensive	roles

The	 defining	 feature	 of	 defensive	 strategy	 during	 corners	 is	 the	 use	 of	 man-to-man	 and	 zonal
marking.	 Man-to-man	 marking	 requires	 a	 player	 to	 closely	 track	 a	 specific	 opponent,	 while	 zonal
marking	requires	a	player	to	defend	a	spatial	region.	Teams	are	frequently	described	as	adopting
either	man-to-man,	zonal,	or	‘hybrid'	(mixed)	systems	to	defend	corners.	However,	few	teams	use	an
exclusively	zonal	system,	and	it	is	rare	for	a	team	to	have	no	zonally	marking	players	whatsoever3;
most	teams	use	a	hybrid	system	to	defend	corner	kicks	[1].	Video	examples	of	hybrid	systems	used
in	the	2019-20	UEFA	tournaments	can	be	found	here,	here	and	here.

In	this	work,	we	do	not	seek	to	classify	the	defensive	system	of	teams	as	a	whole.	Instead,	we	work
on	 the	 level	 of	 individual	 players,	 using	 supervised	 machine	 learning	 to	 classify	 the	 role	 of	 each
defender.	This	provides	significantly	more	information	about	the	nature	of	a	defensive	system.	We
use	the	XGBoost	[12]	implementation	of	gradient-boosted	decision	trees	to	calculate	the	probability

3	The	number	of	defenders	typically	exceeds	the	number	of	active	attacking	players.	so	at	least	1
defender	is	free	to	zonally	mark.

6

that	 each	 defender	 in	 the	 penalty	 area	 is	 marking	 man-to-man	 (vs	 zonally).	 Gradient	 boosted
decisions	trees	have	been	demonstrated	to	be	a	powerful	tool	for	solving	classification	prediction
problems	with	many	predictors	in	an	efficient	manner	[13].

Players	 marking	 man-to-man	 will	 typically	 start	 in	 close	 proximity	 to	 an	 opponent	 and	 will	 often
cover	a	significant	distance	during	the	corner	kick	as	they	track	the	opposing	player.	Zonally	marking
players,	on	the	other	hand,	tend	to	be	more	stationary.	As	Figure	2	demonstrates,	the	initial	positions
of	attacking	players	in	the	penalty	area	are	grouped	into	two	clusters:	we	therefore	expect	man-to-
man	marking	defenders	to	be	initially	positioned	in	(or,	at	least,	near	to)	one	these	clusters.	Working
with	SL	Benfica’s	analysts,	we	selected	a	set	of	ten	metrics	to	predict	the	roles	of	each	defender4;
these	metrics	are	described	in	Appendix	3.

To	 provide	 data	 for	 training	 and	 testing,	 analysts	 at	 SL	 Benfica	 watched	 500	 movies	 of	 corners
randomly	selected	from	our	data	set	and	manually	identified	the	jersey	numbers	of	the	man-to-man
and	zonally	marking	defenders.	The	resulting	data	set	consists	of	3907	defenders:	55%	were	tagged
as	marking	man-to-man	and	the	remainder	tagged	as	marking	zonally;	the	classes	are	therefore	well-
balanced.	Figure	5	shows	the	initial	positions	of	zonal	(upper-left	panel)	and	man-to-man	marking
players	(upper-right)	in	the	analyst's	sample.	As	anticipated,	a	defender’s	initial	position	is	a	strong
indicator	 of	 their	 defensive	 role.	 Note	 that	 the	 distribution	 of	 man-to-man	 marking	 defenders
resembles	the	spatial	distribution	of	attacking	players	shown	in	the	top-right	panel	of	Figure	2.

Figure	5:	(upper	row)	The	initial	positions	of	the	zonal	(left)	and	man-marking	players	(right)	in	our	training	sample,	based
on	the	manual	classifications	made	by	SL	Benfica's	analysts.	(lower	row)	Results	for	the	full	sample	using	the	classifications
predicted	by	our	boosted	decision	tree.

4	Note	that	our	current	methodology	does	not	explicitly	identify	which	attacking	player	a	man-to-
man	marking	defender	is	marking.

7

Training	 XGBoost	 with	 10-fold	 cross	 validation	 resulted	 in	 a	 classification	 accuracy	 of	 83.4% ±
2.1%5.	Therefore,	the	roles	of	approximately	five	in	every	six	defenders	in	our	training	sample	were
correctly	classified.	The	most	predictive	metrics,	selected	via	their	F-score,	are	discussed	in	Appendix
3.	We	applied	the	decision	tree	to	our	remaining	sample	of	1223	corners	to	predict	the	roles	of	every
defending	player.	The	initial	positions	of	players	classified	as	zonally	marking	(lower-left)	and	man-
to-man	marking	(lower-right)	are	shown	in	Figure	5.	There	is	clearly	a	strong	resemblance	to	the
analyst-annotated	sample.	Two	video	examples	of	defensive	role	classifications	can	be	found	here.

Once	we	have	identified	which	defenders	were	allocated	to	zonal	marking	roles,	we	can	investigate
where	their	zones	were	located.	Figure	6	shows	a	heatmap	of	the	spatial	distribution	of	the	zonal
defenders	for	Team	Y	over	the	130	corner	kicks	they	faced	during	the	2017-18	season.	A	darker	shade
of	blue	indicates	a	higher	occupation	rate	for	a	given	position.

Figure	6:	The	spatial	distribution	of	zonally	marking	defenders	for	Team	Y	during	their	matches	in	the	2017-18	season.
The	arrow	indicates	the	direction	from	which	the	corner	is	taken.

Team	Y	used	a	defensive	system	consisting	of	four	zonally	marking	players	and	four	players	marking
man-to-man.		The	heatmap	clearly	indicates	the	locations	of	the	four	zones:	there	are	four	distinct
peaks	in	the	distribution,	shielding	the	goalmouth	from	the	ball.	The	red	crosses	indicate	the	most
likely	positions	of	each	defender.	The	identities	of	the	four	zonal	defenders	remained	largely	the	same
throughout	 the	 season:	 the	 right-back	 (#4)	 was	 positioned	 at	 the	 near-post,	 the	 left-back	 (#28)
stationed	next	to	him,	with	the	two	center-backs	(#3	and	#2)	defending	the	edge	of	the	six-yard	box.
We	 discuss	 how	 this	 information	 can	 be	 used	 to	 assess	 the	 strengths	 and	 weaknesses	 of	 a	 zonal
system	in	the	following	section.

5	81%	of	the	players	classified	as	zonally	marking	by	the	model	were	tagged	as	such	in	the	training
set	(precision)	and	81%	of	the	players	tagged	as	zonal	markers	in	the	training	set	were	correctly
identified	(recall).

Anticipating	how	an	opponent	will	play	in	different	situations	is	a	crucial	component	of	pre-match
preparation.	 A	 well-prepared	 analysis	 can	 significantly	 increase	 the	 chance	 of	 a	 positive	 outcome
[14,15].	 However,	 evaluating	 an	 opponent	 using	 video	 is	 a	 time-consuming	 process	 and	 so	 club
analysts	are	often	limited	to	watching	up	to	five	matches	to	inform	their	reports	for	the	coaching	staff.
Such	a	small	sample	of	matches	provides	only	a	limited	insight	into	the	range	of	set-piece	strategies
utilized	by	an	opponent.

Our	 methodology	 enables	 us	 to	 rapidly	 identify	 the	 key	 features	 of	 the	 corner	 strategies	 used	 by
teams,	both	offensively	and	defensively,	over	hundreds	of	matches.	In	this	section	we	demonstrate
its	 application	 to	 opposition	 analysis,	 highlighting	 the	 distinct	 corner	 routines	 used	 frequently	 by
four	teams	over	the	course	of	a	season.	Identifying	specific	examples	of	particular	corner	routines
enable	analysts	to	create	a	video	montage	for	coaches.	Our	tools	are	already	being	employed	by	two
professional	 teams	 (SL	 Benfica	 in	 the	 Portuguese	 Primeira	 Liga	 and	 Aalborg	 FC	 in	 the	 Danish
Superliga)	to	analyze	their	opponents	in	upcoming	games.

Figure	7	shows	examples	of	the	corner	routines	used	regularly	by	teams	A	(red),	B	(blue),	C	(green)
and	D	(black)	in	the	2017/18	season.	Each	panel	shows	a	specific	example	of	a	distinct	routine	that
the	team	used	multiple	times	throughout	the	course	of	the	season.	The	circles	indicate	the	starting
position	of	each	player	and	the	dashed	lines	indicate	their	runs	in	the	seconds	that	follow	the	corner
kick.	The	black	solid	line	indicates	the	trajectory	of	the	ball.

A	popular	strategy	used	by	almost	every	team	in	our	sample	is	the	jellyfish.	In	this	strategy,	three	or
four	 players	 start	 in	 a	 cluster	 outside	 the	 six-yard	 box	 before	 making	 gradually	 diverging	 runs
towards	the	box	(see	the	plots	in	rows	3	and	4	in	Figure	7).	Closer	inspection	reveals	that	the	teams
used	 different	 implementations	 of	 this	 strategy,	 varying	 the	 position	 of	 the	 initial	 cluster	 and	 the
length	of	the	runs	made	by	each	player.	One	example	is	the	train,	in	which	players	start	in	a	line	rather
than	 a	 cluster,	 as	 popularized	 by	 the	 England	 team	 at	 the	 2018	 World	 Cup.	 Team	 B	 regularly
employed	the	train,	with	the	line	starting	near	the	penalty	spot	(third	row);	they	also	used	a	variation
of	the	jellyfish	in	which	the	cluster	of	players	was	positioned	in	the	far	corner	of	the	penalty	area
(fourth	 row).	 Team	 A	 employed	 a	 variation	 in	 which	 a	 player	made	 a	 run	 around	 and	 behind	 the
initial	cluster,	aiming	for	the	far	post	(fourth	row)	and	an	unusual	routine	in	which	four	players	start
at	the	far	edge	of	the	six-yard	box	before	running	horizontally	towards	the	ball	(second	row).

Another	 class	 of	 routines	 is	 the	 overload,	 in	 which	 four	 or	 five	 attacking	 players	 are	 initially
positioned	to	crowd	the	six-yard	box	very	close	to	goal.	The	second	row	of	Team	D	shows	an	example
in	which	two	players	positioned	in	front	of	the	near	post	make	runs	out	of	the	six-yard	box	and	round
towards	the	far	post	to	intercept	a	deep	delivery.	The	first	row	for	Team	D	shows	the	reverse	of	this:
two	players	at	the	far	post	run	around	the	box	to	intercept	a	near	post-delivery.	Team	B	also	regularly
employed	a	variant	of	the	overload	(first	row).

Figure	7:	Examples	of	popular	corner	routines	employed	by	four	teams	in	our	dataset.

The	teams	in	our	data	did	not	alternate	randomly	from	one	routine	to	another	as	they	took	corners.
Rather,	they	would	use	a	routine	regularly	over	a	consecutive	series	of	matches	and	then	discard	it,
perhaps	reintroducing	the	routine	later	in	the	season.	For	example,	Team	C	attempted	the	corner
routine	depicted	in	the	fourth	row	five	times	over	three	consecutive	games,	discarded	it	for	six	games
and	then	used	it	three	times	in	one	game.	This	emphasizes	the	need	to	scan	over	a	large	number	of
matches	to	fully	scout	the	range	of	corner	strategies	that	might	be	employed	by	an	opponent	in	their
next	match.

5.2 	Comparing	the	effectiveness	of	zonal	systems

Most	 teams	 choose	 to	 defend	 corners	 using	 a	 mixture	 of	 zonal	 and	 man-to-man	 marking	 players;
however,	coaches	must	still	decide	on	the	number	of	zonal	defenders	to	use	and	where	their	zones
should	be	located.		When	making	these	decisions,	a	coach	will	naturally	want	to	know	how	frequently
(and	where)	a	particular	combination	of	zones	concedes	shots	and	goals.	By	automatically	identifying
zonally	marking	defenders	in	tracking	data,	our	methodology	enables	us	to	analyze	the	effectiveness
of	different	configurations	of	zonal	defenders.	We	now	provide	an	example.

Figure	8	compares	the	shots	and	goals	conceded	by	two	different	zonal	systems,	one	with	four	zonal
defenders	(left	panels)	and	one	with	two	zonal	defenders	(right	panels),	extracted	from	a	sample	of
3500	 corners	 encompassing	 two	 seasons	 of	 tracking	 data.	 The	 four-zone	system	was	 used	 in	 366
corner	kicks	by	eight	different	teams,	and	the	two-zone	system	in	600	corners	by	ten	different	teams.
Both	systems	also	included	man-to-man	marking	defenders	(not	shown).

10

Figure	8:	Comparison	of	the	shots	conceded	by	two	zonal	marking	systems:	4	zonal	markers	(left	plots)	and	2	zonal
markers	(right).	The	upper	plots	show	the	distribution	of	the	positions	of	the	zonal	defenders	in	each	system;	the	lower
plots	indicate	the	delivery	location	of	corners	in	which	shots	or	goals	were	conceded.

The	top	row	of	Figure	8	shows	the	positioning	of	the	zonal	defenders	in	each	system.	The	intensity
of	 the	 color	 is	 proportional	 to	 the	 probability	 that	 a	 defender	 was	 occupying	 that	 position	 at	 the
instant	a	corner	was	taken.	In	the	four-zone	system	(top-left)	the	four	defenders	are	positioned	in	a
ring	around	the	goal	mouth:	the	x’s	indicate	their	most	likely	positions.	In	the	two-zone	system,	the
zones	are	located	at	the	near	post	and	slightly	beyond	the	center	of	the	6-yard	box.	Note	also	that	the
zones	in	the	two-zone	system	are	positioned	closer	to	goal	than	in	the	four-zone	system.

The	lower	panels	in	each	plot	show	the	delivery	location	of	corners	that	resulted	in	a	shot	on	goal
within	6	seconds	of	the	corner	being	taken	(stars	indicate	goals,	dots	indicate	shots	that	missed	the
target	or	were	saved).	The	four-zone	system	conceded	shots	in	33%	of	the	corners	that	it	faced,	while
the	two-zone	system	conceded	shots	in	27%	of	corners	faced.	However,	the	quality	of	the	chances
conceded	were	significantly	lower	in	the	four-zone	system:	7.5%	of	the	shots	conceded	produced	a
goal,	compared	to	13%	in	the	two-zone	system.		The	reason	for	this	is	clear:	in	the	four-zone	system,
most	of	the	shots	allowed	came	from	corners	delivered	outside	of	the	6-yard	box	(lower-left	panel	of
Figure	 8).	 Very	 few	 shots	 occurred	 from	 corners	 delivered	 into	 the	 region	 between	 the	 zonal
defenders	and	the	goal	line.	In	the	two-zone	system,	one-third	of	the	shots	allowed	(and	two-thirds
of	goals	conceded)	were	from	corners	delivered	into	the	6-yard	box.	Closer	inspection	of	the	lower-
right	panel	of	Figure	8	shows	that	many	of	the	goals	conceded	were	from	corners	delivered	either
directly	between	the	two	zonal	players	or	behind	the	second	zonal	player.

The	analysis	in	this	section	demonstrates	that,	while	the	four-zone	system	conceded	slightly	more
shots	on	goal,	those	shots	tended	to	be	from	a	greater	distance	than	the	shots	conceded	by	the	two-
zone	system	and	were	therefore	less	threatening.	Overall,	the	two-zone	system	conceded	goals	at	a

11

higher	rate	than	the	four-zone	system	and	so	can	be	considered	the	less	effective	of	the	two	systems.
This	analysis	can	be	extended	to	any	zonal	system	used	regularly	by	professional	teams.

5.3 	Training	optimization

Teams	 playing	 in	 both	 domestic	 and	 continental	 competitions	 must	 often	 deal	 with	 congested
schedules,	 sometimes	 playing	 matches	 at	 a	 rate	 of	 3	 every	 9	 days.	 	 During	 this	 period,	 the	 days
between	 matches	 are	 reserved	 for	 recovery	 and	 for	 giving	 the	 players	 who	 didn't	 play	 sufficient
physical	load.	Time	working	on	strategy	in	training	is	a	limited	resource	and	many	teams	dedicate
less	than	an	hour	to	practicing	set	pieces.	An	important	application	of	our	tools	is	to	increase	the
impact	of	the	time	that	is	committed	to	practicing	set	pieces	in	training.	This	can	be	achieved	in	two
ways.

First,	as	demonstrated	in	the	previous	section,	our	data-driven	approach	enables	rapid	identification
of	 the	 strengths	 and	 weaknesses	 of	 an	 opponent’s	 defensive	 system	 at	 corner	 kicks.	 Time	 spent
practicing	corner	kicks	in	training	can	then	focus	specifically	on	the	corner	routines	that	are	mostly
likely	to	enable	a	player	to	evade	the	defence	and	take	an	unchallenged	shot	at	goal.	Additionally,
coaches	 can	 brief	 players	 on	 the	 different	 corner	 routines	 used	 regularly	 by	 their	 next	 opponent,
helping	the	players	to	identify	a	routine	from	the	opponent’s	starting	positions	and	anticipate	the
likely	delivery	target	of	the	ball.

Second,	our	system	for	encoding	player	runs	based	on	specific	initial	and	final	zones	introduces	an
intuitive	method	for	helping	players	to	learn	new	corner	routines.	Each	player	needs	to	remember
only	the	alphanumeric	code	for	their	own	run	(e.g.,	4b,	2a,	etc,	as	described	in	Section	3.1)	and	the
delivery	area	of	the	ball	for	each	new	routine.	This	allows	coaches	to	efficiently	introduce	new	corner
routines	that	won’t	have	been	seen	by	an	opponent’s	video	analysts.

Nuno	Mauricio,	the	head	of	Match	Analysis	for	SL	Benfica,	states:	“Corner	kicks	are	perhaps	a	moment
of	the	game	that	is	dominated	by	strategy,	rather	than	a	balance	of	creativity,	tactical	behavior	and
strategy	 as	 in	 open	 play	 situations.	 This	 sort	 of	 analysis	 helps	 a	 coach	 to	 understand	 which	 kind	 of
corners	are	more	effective	against	certain	defensive	setups,	thus	having	a	direct	impact	on	the	training
process	 and	 the	 development	 of	 the	 sport	 itself”.	 The	 implication	 is	 that	 the	 rewards	 of	 practicing
corner	 kicks	 are	 directly	 proportional	 to	 the	 research	 and	 planning	 that	 goes	 into	 them,	 and	 less
dependent	on	the	instinctive,	split-second	creativity	of	players	during	a	match.

6. Summary	and	future	work

Using	player	tracking	and	event	data,	we	have	conducted	an	in-depth	analysis	of	the	offensive	and
defensive	 strategies	 employed	 by	 teams	 in	 corner	 kick	 situations.	 By	 studying	 and	 classifying	 the
runs	made	by	the	attacking	team's	players,	we	have	created	a	‘language’	for	corner	kicks	that	enables
us	to	characterize	each	routine	in	terms	of	a	distinct	set	of	run	combinations.	This	allows	us	to	rapidly
search	a	large	sample	of	corners	for	certain	characteristics	(such	as	a	particular	run,	or	combinations
of	runs)	or	to	find	the	distinct	corner	routines	used	by	a	particular	team.

We	have	also	presented	a	supervised	learning	model	for	classifying	the	role	of	each	defending	player
in	corner	situations.	Using	a	sample	of	500	corners	manually	annotated	by	SL	Benfica’s	analysts,	we

12

trained	 the	 XGBoost	 algorithm	 to	 predict	 whether	 each	 defending	 player	 was	 instructed	 to	 mark
man-to-man	or	zonally,	obtaining	a	cross-validated	classification	accuracy	of	83.4% ± 2.1%.

We	have	demonstrated	how	these	tools	can	be	applied	to	provide	unprecedented	insights	into	the
strategies	used	by	teams	in	corner	kick	situations,	identifying	the	distinct	corner	routines	employed
by	individual	teams	over	the	course	of	a	season	and	quantifying	the	strengths	and	weaknesses	of
different	defensive	systems.

A	natural	next	question	to	ask	is:	which	attacking	routines	are	most	effective	against	a	certain	defensive
set-up?	We	have	refrained	from	providing	an	empirical	answer	to	that	question	in	this	paper	because
of	the	limited	size	and	scope	of	our	data	set.	In	a	follow-up	work	we	will	make	use	of	a	significantly
larger	sample	of	data	to	empirically	investigate	the	most	effective	strategies	for	increasing	the	quality
and	quantity	of	chances	created	in	corner	kick	situations.

Appendix	1	–	Encoding	corners

The	runs	made	during	a	corner	kick	can	be	represented	by	a	42-element	vector,	?!,	in	which	each
element	corresponds	to	a	unique	run	(combination	of	initial	and	target	zones).	The	value	of	xa	for	any
a	?	[1,42]	is	determined	by	calculating	the	product	of	the	probability	of	each	player	occupying	the
corresponding	initial	and	target	zones	and	then	summing	up	the	probability	over	all	active	attacking
players.	The	formulation	is	as	follows:

"!

"!

?! = . P(R!) =

#$%

. P#3???????????&"=P#(??????????&")
#$%

(A1)

where	?#is	the	number	of	active	attacking	players,	P#3???????????’"=	is	the	probability	(i.e.	the	GMM
mixture	 weight)	 that	 player	 ?	 started	 in	 the	 initial	 zone	 of	 run	 R!	 and	 P#(??????????’")	is	 the
probability	that	player	?	ended	in	the	target	zone	of	run	R!.

This	probabilistic	method	for	encoding	runs	therefore	allows	for	uncertainty	in	the	precise	run	type
that	a	player	made.

Appendix	2	–	Non-negative	matrix	factorization

Non-negative	Matrix	Factorization	is	a	linear	algebra	method	that	decomposes	a	high	dimensional
non-negative	matrix	into	two	lower	rank	factor	matrices.	Let	X	be	a	n	x	p	non-negative	matrix	where
element	xab	?	0	?	xab	?	X.	The	rows	of	X	in	our	case	correspond	to	the	6	x	7	=	42	combinations	of	initial
and	target	zones,	while	the	columns	represent	each	of	the	1723	corners	in	our	data	set	(i.e.,	each
column	is	the	encoding	of	a	unique	corner	in	the	data).

Non-negative	Matrix	Factorization	aims	to	find	an	approximation

? ? ??

(A2)

where	W	and	H	are	n	x	r	and	r	x	p	non-negative	matrices,	respectively.	The	factorization	rank	r	is
chosen	such	that	r	<	min(n,p)	and	represents	the	size	of	the	new	basis	set	(the	number	of	distinct	run
combinations,	or	features,	in	our	corner	sample).	Henceforth,	we	will	refer	to	W	as	the	basis	matrix
and	H	as	the	coefficient	matrix.

We	solve	for	W	and	H	by	minimizing	a	distance	function:

the	Frobenius	norm	of	the	difference	between	X	and	the	product	of	the	W	&	H	matrices,	plus	the	sum
of	the	norms	of	the	W	and	H	matrices,	each	multiplied	by	a	regularization	parameter	?,	which	we	set

15

to	1.	The	regularisation	encourages	sparseness	in	the	basis	set	vectors,	which	is	helpful	because	the
number	of	attacking	players	actively	involved	in	corners	is	normally	in	a	fairly	narrow	range	(5-8).
The	 distance	 function	 is	 minimized	 using	 a	 multiplicative	 update	 procedure,	 where	 W	 and	 H	 are
iteratively	 and	 alternately	 updated	 in	 a	 methodology	 not	 dissimilar	 to	 Expectation-Maximisation
[10,16].

We	chose	the	number	of	features	(the	value	of	r)	by	inspecting	how	?? ? ???)
of	the	basis	set,	r,	is	increased	from	1	to	42.	We	selected	r	=	30,	which	is	where	the	gradient	of	this
curve	approaches	zero.

Appendix	3	–	XGBoost	Features

The	key	distinction	between	man-to-man	and	zonal	marking	is	that,	in	the	former,	a	player	is	marking
a	moving	target	rather	than	a	static	region.	Treating	attackers	near	the	goalkeeper	as	a	special	case
and	emphasizing	the	locomotive	reaction	of	the	defenders,	we	selected	the	metrics	listed	below	as
predictive	variables	for	our	XGBoost	classifier	[12].	These	variables	were	vetted	by	video	analysts	at
SL	Benfica	(note	that	our	methodology	does	not	identify	the	specific	opponent	a	defender	is	man-
marking).	The	most	predictive	features,	selected	via	their	F-score,	are	marked	with	an	asterisk	in	the
list	above:

initial	proximity	to	goalkeeper	*

initial	position	(x	coordinate)	*
initial	position	(y	coordinate)	*

2.
3.  distance	between	start	and	target	positions	*
4.
5.  average	distance	travelled	by	attacking	players	in	the	same	initial	zone	*
6.  average	distance	travelled	by	other	defenders	in	the	same	initial	zone	*
7.
initial	zone
8.  target	zone
9.  number	of	attacking	players	in	the	same	initial	zone
10. number	of	other	defenders	in	the	same	initial	zone

There	 are	 several	 variables	 that	 are	 important	 in	 predicting	 role	 classifications	 but,	 as	 Figure	 5
demonstrates,	even	just	the	initial	positions	of	the	defenders	are	a	useful	discriminator.	Using	only
the	initial	positions	as	independent	variables	in	a	simple	logistic	regression	classifier	provides	70%
classification	 accuracy	 for	 the	 defensive	 roles	 in	 our	 training	 set.	 Adding	 the	 distance	 travelled
between	 player	 start	 and	 target	 locations	 as	 a	 variable	 in	 the	 logistic	 regression	 increases	 the
classification	accuracy	to	74%.
